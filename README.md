## Bioinformatics Analyst 

#### 1. Experience with Bioinformatics Analysis Pipelines
I have extensive experience in developing and applying bioinformatics pipelines for analyzing single-cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets. Key highlights include:

- **Pipeline Development**: Developed end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines for preprocessing, alignment, and differential expression analysis using tools like STAR, HISAT2, and Kallisto.
- **Single-Cell Data**: Utilized Seurat and Scanpy for clustering and visualization, ensuring accurate cell-type identification.
- **Spatial Data**: Explored spatial transcriptomics using SpatialDE and STUtility for tissue-specific gene expression analysis.
- **Programming Languages**: Proficient in Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy) and R (Seurat, ggplot2, dplyr), with workflow automation using Snakemake and Nextflow.
- **Cloud Computing**: Leveraged AWS and Google Cloud for scalable processing of large RNA-seq datasets.

#### 2. Alignment Tools and Quality Metrics
For RNA-seq alignment and quality control, I typically use:
- **Alignment Tools**:
  - STAR: Fast and accurate for bulk RNA-seq.
  - HISAT2: Efficient for large genomes.
  - Cell Ranger: Optimized for single-cell RNA-seq.
  - Kallisto: Pseudo-alignment for exploratory analyses.
- **Quality Metrics**:
  - Read Quality: FastQC for checking quality and contamination.
  - Mapping Efficiency: Percentage of uniquely mapped reads.
  - Duplication Rates: Picard tools for monitoring duplication.
  - Batch Effects: Tools like ComBat or Harmony to remove technical variations.

#### 3. Identifying Groups of Cells or Gene Sets
To identify groups of cells or gene sets:
- Normalize data and identify highly variable genes.
- Apply dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).
- Perform clustering using Louvain or k-means.
- Use differential expression analysis to identify marker genes.
- Conduct gene set enrichment analysis with GSEA or DAVID.

#### 4. Cross-Species Single-Cell RNA-Seq Comparison
To compare datasets from mice and humans:
1. Normalize and preprocess data.
2. Map orthologous genes using Ensembl Biomart or HomoloGene.
3. Integrate datasets using Seurat v3 Integration or Liger.
4. Identify clusters and compare transcriptional profiles.
5. Visualize results with integrated UMAP plots and comparative heatmaps.
